# YelpONTHEGO - A SMS Assistant Application

YelpOnTheGo! as it suggests, an API to provide valuable and required information for a user on the go! The user just need to send a text message to a provided number which calls the service. And in return a bunch of response is sent back to user.
This includes,
1. Answer to user’s query from Yelp API.
It also provides some extra features or extra information about the query to user not just the answer. Such as
   1. Reviews of location
   2. Address of location
   3. Image URL’s of location
2. An image of location map using GoogleMap API marking some or all the responses given in 1st step
The overall simplified architecture of this project is shown in below image.
